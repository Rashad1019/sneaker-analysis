## 💡 Why It Matters

Sneaker reselling is a multi-billion dollar market driven by hype, scarcity, and timing. Choosing the wrong inventory can lead to deadstock and losses. This analysis helps resellers:
- Source smarter
- Sell faster
- Maximize profits

## 📊 Key Findings

A clustering algorithm grouped sneakers into 4 distinct clusters based on resale performance. One of them — **Cluster 1** — outperformed the rest:

- **Avg. Sell-Through Rate:** 83%
- **Avg. Resale Price:** $83.29
- **Avg. Days to Sell:** 59
- **Limited Edition Rate:** Low (only 2%), proving hype isn’t everything

### 🔥 Top Sneakers in Cluster 1:
- **Air Jordan 1 Mid**
- **Puma Smash V2**
- **Skechers D’Lites**
- **Lacoste Carnaby Evo**
- All had sell-through rates above 98% with strong pricing and predictable turnover.
